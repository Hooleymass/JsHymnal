O give us homes built firm upon the Saviour;
Where Christ is head and counsellor and guide;
Where every child is taught His love and favour
And gives his heart to Christ, the crucified;
How sweet to know that tho his footsteps waver
His faithful Lord is walking by his side!


O give us homes with godly fathers, mothers,
Who always place their hope and trust in Him;
Whose tender patience turmoil never bothers,
Whose calm and courage trouble cannot dim;
A home where each find joy in serving others,
And love still shines tho days be dark and grim. 


O give us homes where Christ is Lord and Master;
The Bible read, the precious hymns still sung;
Where prayer comes first in peace or in disaster,
And praise is natural speech to every tongue;
Where mountains move before a faith that's vaster,
And Christ sufficient is for old and young. 


O Lord, our God, our homes are thine forever!
We trust to Thee their problems, toil and care;
Their bonds of love no enemy can sever
If thou art always Lord and Master there;
Be Thou the centre of our least endeavour
Be Thou our guest, our hearts and homes to share.
