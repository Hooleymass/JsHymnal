Would you be a victor over ev'ry foe,
Conquer ev'ry trial in this world below;
Overcome temptations that each day you meet?
Keep in touch with Jesus, He will keep you sweet.

Keep in touch with Jesus, though the paths be dim;
Let no clouds nor shadows sever you from Him.
Joy or sorrow greet you, friend or foe you meet,
Keep in touch with Jesus, He will keep you sweet.

Many hearts are broken- oft an aching breast
Waits the message spoken that will give it rest;
You perhaps can bring them joy and peace complete,
Keep in touch with Jesus, He will keep you sweet.

Would you be a blessing all along the way,
Would you be possessing perfect love each day?
Let the Holy Spirit overcome defeat,
Keep in touch with Jesus, He will keep you sweet.

Would you have communion with your Lord each day,
Have a blessed union with Him all the way;
Praying without ceasing, learning at His feet?
Keep in touch with Jesus, He will keep you sweet.
