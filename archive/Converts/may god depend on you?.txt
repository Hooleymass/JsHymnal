In the warfare that is waging
For the truth and for the right,
When the conflict fierce is raging
With the powers of the night,
God needs people brave and true;
May He then depend on you?
 May the Lord depend on you?
Loyalty is but His due;
Say, O spirit brave and true,
That He may depend on you.

See, they come on sable pinions,
Come in strong satanic might, - 
Powers come and dark dominions
From the regions of the night.
God requires the brave and true;
May He then depend on you?

From His throne the Father sees us;
Angels help us to prevail;
And our Leader true is Jesus,
And we shall not cannot fail.
Triumph crowns the brave and true;
May the Lord depend on you?
