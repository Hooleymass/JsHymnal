I've been on Mount Pisgah's lofty height,
And I've satisfied my longing heart's desire;
For I caught a glimpse of glory bright,
And my soul is burning with the fire.

O the fire is burning, yes, 'tis brightly burning,
O 'tis burning, burning in my soul;
O the fire is burning, yes, 'tis brightly burning,
O 'tis burning, burning in my soul.

I will walk with Jesus, bless His name,
And to be like Him I ev'ry day aspire;
For His love is like a heav'nly flame,
And my soul is burning with the fire.

I my all upon the altar lay,
As I to my closet lovingly retire;
And the flame consumes while there I pray,
And my soul is burning with the fire.

By faith's eye I scan the ocean's foam,
And beyond I see the haven I desire;
There I view the beacon lights of home,
And my soul is burning with the fire.
