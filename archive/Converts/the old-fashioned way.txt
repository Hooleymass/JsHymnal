They call me old-fashioned because I believe
That the Bible is God's Holy Word.
That Jesus who lived among men long ago
Is divine and the Christ of God 

My sin was old-fashioned,
My guilt was old-fashioned,
God's love was old-fashioned I know,
And the way I was saved was the old-fashioned way,
Through the blood that makes whiter than snow.

Old-fashioned, because I believe and accept
Only what has been spoken from heav'n;
Old-fashioned, because at the cross I was saved,
At the cross I had my sin forgiv'n. 

Old-fashioned, because I am bound to do right,
To walk in the straight, narrow way;
Because I have given my whole life to God,
Old-fashioned because I pray. 

Old-fashioned, because I'm looking above
To Jesus, my glorified Lord;
Because I believe He is coming again,
Fulfilling His Holy Word.
