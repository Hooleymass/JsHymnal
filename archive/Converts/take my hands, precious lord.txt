When my way grows drear precious Lord linger near 
When my life is almost gone 
Hear my cry, hear my call 
Hold my hand lest I fall 
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home 

Precious Lord, take my hand 
Lead me on, let me stand 
I'm tired, I'm weak, Lord I'm worn 
Through the storm, through the night 
Lead me on to the light 
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When the darkness appears and the night draws near 
And the day is past and gone 
At the river I stand 
Guide my feet, hold my hand 
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home 

When my work here is done, and my race here is run,
Let me see by the light Thou hast shone;
That there's a city so bright with the Lamb as the Light,
Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me on.
