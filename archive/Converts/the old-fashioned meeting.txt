O how well I remember in the old-fashioned days,
When some old-fashioned people had some old-fashioned ways,
In the old-fashioned meetings, as they tarried there
In the old-fashioned manner, how God answered their pray'r.

'Twas an old-fashioned meeting in an old-fashioned place,
Where some old-fashioned people had some old-fashioned grace:
As an old-fashioned sinner I began to pray,
And God heard me and saved me in an old-fashioned way.

There was singing such singing of those old-fashioned airs,
There was power, such power in those old-fashioned pray'rs!
An old-fashioned conviction made the sinner pray,
And the Lord heard and saved him in the old-fashioned way.

Well, they say it is better, "Things have changed, don't you know?"
And the people in gen'ral, seem to think it is so;
And they call me old-fashioned when I dare to say
That I like it far better in the old-fashioned way.

If the Lord never changes as the fashions of men,
If He's always the same, why, He is old-fashioned then!
As an old-fashioned sinner saved thru old-time grace,
O I'm sure He will take me to an old-fashioned place.
