I've a message from the Lord, hallelujah!
The message unto you I bring;
'Tis recorded in His Word, hallelujah!
It is only that you look and live.

Look and live! My brother live!
Look to Jesus now and live!
'Tis recorded in His Word, hallelujah!
It is only that you look and live.

I've a message full of love, hallelujah!
A message, oh my friend, for you;
'Tis a message from above, hallelujah!
Jesus said it and I know 'tis true.

Life is offered unto thee, hallelujah!
Eternal life thy soul shall have;
If you only look to Him, hallelujah!
Look to Jesus who alone can save.
