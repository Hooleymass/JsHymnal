I trust in God wherever I may be, 
Upon the land or on the rolling sea, 
For, come what may, from day to day, 
My heav'nly Father watches over me. 

I trust in God, I know He cares for me, 
On mountain bleak or on the stormy sea; 
Tho' billows roll, He keeps my soul, 
My heavn'ly Father watches over me. 

He makes the rose an object of His care, 
He guides the eagle thru the pathless air, 
And surely He remembers me, 
My heav'nly Father watches over me. 

I trust in God, for in the lion's den, 
On battlefield, or in the prison pen, 
Through praise or blame, through flood or flame, 
My heav'nly Father watches over me. 

The valley may be dark, the shadows deep 
But O, The Shepherd guards His lonely sheep; 
And through the gloom, He'll lead me home 
My heav'nly Father watches over me.
