My name is in the book of Life,
Oh, bless the name of Jesus;
I rise above all doubt and strife,
And read my title clear.

I know, I know,
My name is there;
I know, I know,
My name is written there.

My name once stood with sinners lost,
And bore a painful record;
But by His blood the Savior crossed,
And placed it on His roll.

Yet inward trouble often cast,
A shadow o'er my title;
But now with full salvation blest,
Praise God! it's ever clear.

While others climb through worldly strife
To carve a name of honor,
High up in heaven's book of Life,
My name is written there.
