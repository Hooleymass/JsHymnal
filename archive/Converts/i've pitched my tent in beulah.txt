I long ago left Egypt for the promised land,
I trusted in my Saviour and to His guiding hand,
He led me out to vict'ry through the great Red sea,
I sang a song of triumph, and shouted, "I am free."

You need not look for me, down in Egypt's sand,
For I have pitched my tent far up in Beulah land;
You need not look for me, down in Egypt's sand,
For I have pitched my tent far up in Beulah land.

I followed close beside Him and the land soon found,
I did not halt or tremble, for Canaan I was bound,
My Guide I fully trusted and He led me in,
I shouted, "Hallelujah, my heart is free from sin."

I started for the highlands where the fruits abound,
I pitched my tent near Hebron, there grapes of Eschol found,
With milk and honey flowing and new wine so free,
I have no love for Egypt, it has no charms for me.

My heart is so enraptured as I press along,
Each day I find new blessings, which fill my heart with joy,
I'm ever marching forward to that land on high,
Some day I'll reach my mansion that's builded in the sky.
