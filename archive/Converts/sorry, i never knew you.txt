Last night as I was sleeping, this dream came to me;
I dreamed about the end of time about eternity;
I saw a million sinners fall on their faces to pray,
The Saviour sadly shook His head, and this I heard Him say;
Sorry, I never knew you, depart from me for ever more;
Sorry, I never knew you, go and serve the one that you served before.

I thought the time had come when I must stand the trial,
I told the Lord that I had been a Christian all the while;
But through the book He then looked, and sadly shook His head;
They placed me over on His left, and this is what He said;
Sorry, I never knew you, I find no record of your birth;
Sorry, I never knew you, go and serve the one you served while on earth.

There was my wife and children, I heard each one's voice,
They must have all been happy, it seemed they did rejoice,
With robes of white around them, and crowns upon their head;
My little girl looked up at me, and this is what she said;
Daddy, we can't go with you, we must stay on this lovely shore;
Sorry, for we still love you, but you cannot be our Daddy any more.

When I from sleep awakened, with tears in my eyes,
I looked around, and there about me, to my great surprise,
I saw my wife and babies, and knew I'd had a dream,
Then down beside my bed I fell, and for mercy did scream;
Father, Who art in glory, in mercy look on me today;
Forgive me let me serve Thee, till the summon comes and takes me away.
