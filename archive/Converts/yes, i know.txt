Come, ye sinners, lost and lonely, 
Jesus' blood can make you free; 
For He saved the worst among you, 
When He saved a wretch like me. 

And I know, yes, I know 
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean, 
And I know, yes, I know 
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean. 

To the faint He giveth power, 
Through the mountains makes a way; 
Findeth water in the desert, 
Turns the night to golden day. 

In temptation He is near thee, 
Holds the pow'rs of hell at bay; 
Guides you to the path of safety, 
Gives you grace for every day
