I am now a child of God, I've been washed in Jesus blood,
Making me an heir to wealth beyond compare;
So while here I press along, daily this shall me my song:
I'm a happy millionaire.

I'm a millionaire, I'm a millionaire;
My father is rich in houses and lands and I'm His heir.
I'm a millionaire, I'm a millionaire;
I'm a happy millionaire.

I had rather served my God, feast upon His holy word
Than to own this world with all its jewels rare;
By His Spirit I am led, and on milk and honey fed,
I'm a happy millionaire.

Lord I'd rather worship Thee with the people who are free
Than to pleasures of this world in seasons share;
For my Father is the King, and His praise I'll ever sing,
I'm a happy millionaire.

Since salvation now is mine, for the Lord I'll shout and shine
Though I have to go through life on meager fare;
Rich in grace beyond recall for my Father owns it all,
I'm a happy millionaire.
