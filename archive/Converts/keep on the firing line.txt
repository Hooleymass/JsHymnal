If you're in the battle for the Lord and right,
Keep on the firing line;
If you'll win the vict'ry, brother, you must fight,
Keep on the firing line;
There are many dangers which we all must face,
If we die still fighting it is no disgrace,
Cowards in the service should not have a place,
Keep on the firing line.

You must fight and be brave against all evil,
Never run, though foes combine;
If you must fight for God and right,
Keep on the firing line.

God will only use a soldier He can trust,
Keep on the firing line;
If you'll wear the crown, then bear the cross you must,
Keep on the firing line;
Life is but to labour for the Master dear,
Help to banish darkness and to spread good cheer,
We shall be rewarded for our service here,
Keep on the firing line.

When we get to heaven we shall be so glad,
Keep on the firing line;
We shall praise the Saviour for the call we had,
Keep on the firing line;
'Twill be joy to see the souls we helped to win,
Those we led to Jesus, from the paths of sin,
Hear their welcome plaudit and go marching in,
Keep on the firing line.
