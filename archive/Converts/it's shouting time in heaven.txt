I will arise and go to Jesus,
He will embrace me in his arms;
In the arms of Christ my Saviour,
Oh, there are ten thousand charms.

It's shouting time in Heaven;
A sinner once lost is found.
It's shouting time in Heaven;
Salvation has been brought down.
No wonder the angels rejoice to know
My sins have been covered by the crimson flow,
And now I'm feeling fine;
I'm walking on the highway with my Lord.
My name is written down
In the courts above,
It's shouting time in Heaven;
Oh, yes, it's shouting time.

Come, ye weary , heavy laden,
Lost and ruined by the fall.
If you tarry 'til you're better
You will never come at all.
