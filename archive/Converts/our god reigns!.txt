How lovely on the mountains are the feet of Him
Who brings good news, good news,
Proclaiming peace, announcing news of happiness,
Our God reigns, Our God reigns!

Our God reigns! our God reigns!
Our God reigns! our God reigns!

You watchmen lift your voices joyfully as one,
Shout for your King, your King;
See eye to eye the Lord restoring Zion:
Your God reigns, your God reigns!

Waste places of Jerusalem break forth with joy,
We are redeemed, redeemed;
The Lord has saved and comforted His people:
Your God reigns, your God reigns!

Ends of the earth, see the salvation of your God,
Jesus is Lord, is Lord;
Before the nations He has bared His holy arm:
Your God reigns, your God reigns!
