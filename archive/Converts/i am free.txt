So long, I searched for life's meaning-
Enslaved by the world and my greed-
Then the door of my prison was opened by love-
For the ransom was paid- 
I was free!

I'm free from the fear of tomorrow-
I'm free from the guilt of my past-
I've traded my shackles for a glorious song-
I'm free- Praise the Lord, free at last!

I am free from the guilt that I carried-
From the dull empty life- I'm set free-
For when I met Jesus he made me complete,
He forgot the foolish child I used to be-

I'm free from the guilt that I carried,
From that dull empty life I'm set free;
For when I met Jesus, He made me complete,
He forgot how foolish I used to be.
